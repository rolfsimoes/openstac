Description: 
    Implements STAC and OGC API Features server. Users can connect to 
    MongoDB database to create robust STAC API servers in production 
    environments. With streamlined workflows for generating STAC documents 
    and deploying datasets, users can easily share their geospatial data 
    with others. openstac design facilitates package extension to 
    accommodate additional components of the STAC specification.
